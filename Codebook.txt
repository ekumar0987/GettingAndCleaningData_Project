Data Source: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

Experiment:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, 
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear 
acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly 
partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap 
(128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration 
and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features 
was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

Feature Selection (as seen in the initial dataset):

The features provided in the initial dataset come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) 
were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 
Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a 
corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). 
Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. 
(Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'features.txt'

Data transformation:

Data has been collected from Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset and transformed into tables in R. Data from various tables containing test/train subjects, test/train
activities and test/train feature measurements have all been merged into a single table. The values in features.txt file was used as initial variable names.

Detailed steps regarding data analysis and transformation has been included in the readme.md file and run_anlaysis.R

Data objects used in the script - 

1. tbl_testData - Test data measurements from X_test.txt file
2. tbl_testSubjects - Test data subjects from subject_test.txt
3. tbl_testActivities - Test activity ID from y_test.txt
4. tbl_trainData - Train data measurements from X_train.txt file
5. tbl_trainSubjects - Train data subjects from subject_train.txt
6. tbl_trainActivities - Train activity ID from y_train.txt
7. tbl_features - Variable names from features.txt
8. tbl_activities - Activity ID and names from activity_labels.txt
9. tbl_test_Sub_Actvt - Intermediate table that holds details about test subjects and activities
10. tbl_test_All - Complete table of test data (Subject, activities and feature measurements)
11. tbl_train_Sub_Actvt - Intermediate table that holds details about train subjects and activities
12. tbl_train_All - Complete table of train data (Subject, activities and feature measurements)
13. tbl_completeExperimentData - Merged test and training dataset
14. tbl_mean_std_ExpData - Table of mean and standard deviations of the complete experiment data set
15. tbl_avgExperimentData - Average of each variable for each activity and each subject

The initial variable names have been slighly adjusted so as to make the data more readable. A variety of short hand names were included in the variable names of the initial 
dataset. This reduces readability and also violates the principles of tidy data. Therefore, in this process short hand names have been replaced by complete descriptive names. 
Specifically - "Acc" has been replaced with "Acceleration", "Gyro" with "AngularVelocity", "Mag" with"Magnitude","mean" with "Mean","std" with "Std" and "Freq" with "Frequency". 
Special characters were also removed from the variable names. 

The result of this has been that the variable names are more descriptive and easy to follow. They have been converted to camel case like in most programming languages and they 
include in the name all the measures that were taken to derive its value. One such complete example would be renaming "fBodyGyro-meanFreq()-X" 
to "fBodyAngularVelocityMeanFrequencyX". The data contained here would be just what the name indicates - The mean frequency of the angular velocity along the x axis in the frequency
domain. Although wordy this transformation has resulted in a much more cleaner variable name that is easy to work with during subsequent stages of data analysis
